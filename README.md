### Why Egg Timer?

Many times when I'm cooking my breakfast, I always can't control the doneness of the boiled egg. If I want the egg to be more soft, I might get a totally raw egg when I crack the shell and when I want to cook the egg a bit more, the yolk will become hard and not tasty at all. Therefore, I came up with the idea of making this egg timer to help me control the doneness of the egg as precisely as I can.
